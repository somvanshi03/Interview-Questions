## Azure Architect Questions

### Q1: How would you design a secure hub-and-spoke network topology in Azure?

**Answer:**
A hub-and-spoke model is ideal for enforcing centralized security while maintaining environment isolation. The design centers on a central hub virtual network hosting shared services like Azure Firewall and Azure VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway for on-premises connectivity. Each environment (Dev, Test, Prod) would be separate spoke virtual networks peered directly to the hub .

Key implementation steps:
- Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) at the subnet level for granular control
- Implement Azure Policy to enforce traffic routing through the hub firewall
- Integrate Azure Private Endpoints for PaaS services (SQL, Storage) to keep traffic on Microsoft backbone
- Deploy Azure DDoS Protection Standard for enhanced security 

### Q2: What is an Azure Landing Zone and what are its key design areas?

**Answer:**
An Azure Landing Zone is a pre-configured, scalable cloud foundation designed according to best practices to host workloads securely and efficiently. It provides a standardized framework supporting migration, modernization, and innovation at scale .

The eight core design areas are:
1. **Identity and Access Management** - Authentication and authorization
2. **Resource Organization** - Management groups and subscription structure  
3. **Network Topology and Connectivity** - Hub-spoke design, firewalls
4. **Security and Governance** - Policies, compliance controls
5. **Management and Monitoring** - Logging, alerting
6. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery** - Backup, failover
7. **Cost Governance** - Budgets, optimization
8. **Platform Automation and DevOps** - CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code 

### Q3: How would you handle unpredictable traffic spikes cost-effectively?

**Answer:**
For unpredictable traffic, I'd use a multi-layered PaaS-first approach :

- **Web tier**: Deploy on Azure App Service Premium v3 with Azure Front Door for global load balancing and DDoS protection
- **State management**: Externalize sessions to Azure Cache for Redis to prevent affinity issues
- **Data layer**: Use Azure SQL Hyperscale or Cosmos DB serverless mode for rapid scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Implement policies based on metrics like CPU or queue length with conservative default counts
- **Cost controls**: Set budget alerts in Azure Cost Management as a safety net

### Q4: Explain the difference between Availability Sets and Virtual Machine Scale Sets

**Answer:**
**Availability Sets** ensure high availability by distributing VMs across multiple fault domains (physical hardware separation) and update domains (maintenance windows). They protect against hardware failures and planned maintenance events within a datacenter .

**Virtual Machine Scale Sets** enable automatic scaling of VM instances based on demand. They provide elasticity by automatically adjusting the number of instances and allow managing, configuring, and updating many VMs as a single unit .

### Q5: How do you secure legacy applications that can't be modified?

**Answer:**
When code modification isn't possible, focus on infrastructure and identity security :
- Disable public endpoint exposure and provision **Private Endpoints** to route traffic through Azure backbone
- Use **Managed Identities** for authentication if the hosting environment supports it
- Store credentials in **Azure Key Vault** with strict access policies
- Implement network isolation with NSGs and firewalls

## AWS Architect Questions

### Q1: What's the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?

**Answer:**
When an instance is **stopped**, it performs a regular shutdown and EBS volumes remain attached. You can start it again anytime and don't pay for compute time while stopped .

When an instance is **terminated**, it performs a shutdown and EBS volumes are deleted by default (unless "Delete on Termination" is set to false). The instance cannot be run again .

### Q2: How does a Spot Instance differ from an On-Demand Instance?

**Answer:**
**On-Demand Instances** are purchased at a fixed price with no commitment required. You pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no upfront payment .

**Spot Instances** use a bidding model where you specify the maximum price you're willing to pay (Spot price). They can be significantly cheaper (up to 90% off) but AWS can reclaim the instance with a 2-minute warning if the Spot price exceeds your bid .

### Q3: How would you design a highly available architecture on AWS?

**Answer:**
To achieve 99.99% availability :
- Use **Application Load Balancer** distributing traffic across EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones
- Deploy **RDS with Multi-AZ** for database high availability with read replicas
- Implement **CloudFront with S3 origin** for static assets to reduce latency
- Configure **Auto Scaling groups** with target tracking policies based on CPU and custom metrics
- Set up **Route 53 health checks** with failover routing for cross-region redundancy

### Q4: What are the core components of AWS pricing?

**Answer:**
AWS pricing consists of four main components :
- **Compute**: Charged by instance hours or second (EC2, Lambda)
- **Storage**: Charged per GB stored (S3, EBS, Glacier)
- **Data Transfer**: Inbound data is typically free, outbound is tiered
- **Database**: Based on instance hours and storage (RDS, DynamoDB)

### Q5: How do you approach cost optimization in AWS?

**Answer:**
A comprehensive cost optimization strategy includes :
- **Rightsizing**: Analyze CloudWatch metrics to downsize over-provisioned instances
- **Scheduling**: Stop non-production instances outside business hours using Lambda
- **Savings Plans**: Purchase for baseline workloads (30%+ savings)
- **Storage optimization**: Transition infrequently accessed data to S3 Intelligent-Tiering or Glacier
- **Cleanup**: Remove orphaned EBS snapshots and unused Elastic IPs
- **Tagging**: Implement resource tagging for cost allocation and showback
