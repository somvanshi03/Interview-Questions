| **Cloud Spanner** | Databases | Fully-managed, mission-critical relational database with global distribution, strong consistency, and high availability . |
| **Cloud Bigtable** | Databases | Fast, fully-managed, scalable NoSQL database for large analytical and operational workloads (1TB to hundreds of PB) . |
| **Firestore** | Databases | NoSQL document database built for mobile and web app development. Provides live synchronization and offline support . |
| **Memorystore** | Databases | Fully-managed in-memory data store service (supports Redis and Memcached) for sub-millisecond data access and caching . |
| **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** | Networking | Configurable, private network topology for GCP resources. Provides IP allocation, routing, and firewall policies . |
| **Cloud Load Balancing** | Networking | Fully-managed, software-defined load balancing service that distributes traffic across multiple instances and regions . |
| **Cloud CDN** | Networking | Content Delivery Network using Google's globally distributed edge points of presence to cache content close to users . |
| **Cloud DNS** | Networking | High-performance, resilient, managed DNS service running on Google's infrastructure . |
| **Cloud Armor** | Networking | Web application firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection service to defend applications against attacks . |
| **Cloud Interconnect** | Networking | Service that extends on-premises networks to Google Cloud with dedicated, high-speed connections . |
| **Cloud NAT** | Networking | Network Address Translation service enabling private instances to access the internet without public IP addresses . |
| **Cloud IAM** | Security & Identity | Identity and Access Management service for defining fine-grained access policies and permissions for cloud resources . |
| **Cloud KMS** | Security & Identity | Key Management Service for creating, managing, and using encryption keys securely . |
| **Security Command Center** | Security & Identity | Centralized security and risk management platform for visibility, threat detection, and compliance . |
| **Cloud Logging** | Operations | Fully-managed service for collecting, storing, and analyzing log data from applications and GCP services . |
| **Cloud Monitoring** | Operations | Provides visibility into application performance, uptime, and health with metrics, dashboards, and alerts . |
| **Cloud Deployment Manager** | Management Tools | Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service for automating resource creation and management using declarative templates . |
| **Cloud Profiler** | Operations | Continuous performance analysis tool that helps identify and optimize high-consumption resources in applications . |
| **BigQuery** | Analytics | Serverless, highly scalable data warehouse for large-scale data analytics and real-time insights . |
| **Pub/Sub** | Integration | Scalable, fully-managed messaging service for ingesting and delivering real-time event streams . |
| **Vertex AI** | AI & Machine Learning | Unified platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models with pre-trained APIs and custom training . |

### 🗺️ GCP Resource Hierarchy

To effectively organize and govern these resources, it's essential to understand GCP's hierarchical structure :

- **Organization**: The root node in the hierarchy, representing your company. All resources and policies are ultimately governed here.
- **Folders**: Containers within an organization used to group projects based on departments, teams, or applications. Policies applied at folder level are inherited by all contained projects.
- **Projects**: The fundamental level for organizing and managing GCP resources. Each project has separate settings, permissions, and billing. Every resource belongs to exactly one project.
- **Resources**: The individual services themselves (Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, etc.).

This hierarchy enables administrators to apply IAM policies and organization rules consistently across teams and environments .

### 💡 How to Use This Information

As an architect, you will combine these resources to build solutions. For example, to host a scalable web application, you might use **Cloud Run** or **GKE** for compute, configure a **VPC** for private networking, use **Cloud Load Balancing** for traffic distribution, store data in **Cloud SQL** and static files in **Cloud Storage**, and manage everything with **Deployment Manager** templates .
